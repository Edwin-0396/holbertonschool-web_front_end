# JavaScript Advanced Exercises

## Summary
This document outlines various JavaScript exercises designed to provide an in-depth understanding of advanced topics like lexical scoping, closures, binding, callbacks, and execution stack order. Each task guides users through creating specific functions and closures, simulating private methods, manipulating the DOM, and managing execution timing to reinforce these concepts. Detailed instructions are provided for implementing and testing the tasks to ensure comprehension.

## Key Points
- **Resources and Learning Objectives**: Introduces articles and videos covering concepts such as lexical scoping, closures, binding, callbacks, and more.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Task 0: Lexical Scoping and Welcome Message**: Create a function `welcome` that utilizes lexical scoping to display a welcome message.
  - **Task 1: Closure Scope Chain**: Demonstrate nested functions and closures by creating a sequence of alerts.
  - **Task 2: Using Closures for Greet Messages**: Implement closures to create personalized welcome functions.
  - **Task 3: Closures in Loops**: Build a function to create an array of seat numbers using closures within a loop.
  - **Task 4: Complex Closures for Mathematical Operations**: Develop closures for division and addition operations.
  - **Task 5: Changing DOM Styles with Closures**: Use a closure to change the style of the web page in response to button clicks.
  - **Task 6: Private Methods with Closures**: Simulate private methods in a module managing student scores.
  - **Task 7: Execution Stack and `setTimeout`**: Examine stack order by logging messages and using `setTimeout`.
  - **Task 8: Function Execution Order**: Manage order processing and payments via sequential function calls.
  - **Task 9: Timing Execution for Counting Primes**: Measure execution time for counting prime numbers between 2 and 100.
